**Part A:** Return to the main characters from your three favorite films. 

- What was one important choice they had to make where the stakes were **high**?

-  What were the **stakes**?

- Can you identify them as internal, external or philosophical?

**Part B:** Think about a difficult choice you had to make in your own life.  What was at stake? 

**Part C:** Return to one of the obstacles your character might face from the previous exercise. Now think of the **choice** this obstacle forces them to make. Answer the following:

- What are the possible stakes of this choice?

- Can you come up with an internal, external or philosophical stake which applies to this choice?

## What is a matrix?

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns.

Matrices can be useful for organizing and manipulating data. They can also be used as a tool to help solve systems of equations.

## How do we multiply a matrix by a scalar?

To multiply a matrix by a scalar, we multiply each entry in the matrix by the scalar. For example, if 

$A = \begin{bmatrix} 
2 & 3 \\
1 & 4 \\
\end{bmatrix}$

and we want to multiply $A$ by $2$, we can multiply each entry by $2$ to get:

$2A = \begin{bmatrix} 
4 & 6 \\
2 & 8 \\
\end{bmatrix}$

## How do we add or subtract two matrices?

To add or subtract two matrices, we add or subtract corresponding entries. So if 

$A = \begin{bmatrix} 
2 & 3 \\
1 & 4 \\
\end{bmatrix}$ 

and 

$B = \begin{bmatrix} 
5 & 2 \\
3 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}$,

then 

$A+B = \begin{bmatrix} 
7 & 5 \\
4 & 5 \\
\end{bmatrix}$

and 

$A-B = \begin{bmatrix} 
-3 & 1 \\
-2 & 3 \\
\end{bmatrix}$

## How do we multiply two matrices together?

This one\'s a bit trickier. To multiply two matrices together, we take the dot product of the rows from the first matrix with the columns from the second matrix. The result is a new matrix. For example, if 

$A = \begin{bmatrix} 
2 & 3 \\
1 & 4 \\
\end{bmatrix}$ 

and 

$B = \begin{bmatrix} 
5 & 2 \\
3 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}$,

then 

$AB = \begin{bmatrix} 
2\cdot5+3\cdot3 & 2\cdot2+3\cdot1 \\
1\cdot5+4\cdot3 & 1\cdot2+4\cdot1 \\
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 
19 & 7 \\
17 & 6 \\
\end{bmatrix}.$

## What can we do with the inverse of a matrix?

Finding the inverse of a matrix can be useful for solving linear systems of equations. If $A$ is the matrix representing the system of equations, and $b$ is the vector of solutions, then $Ax=b$. If we can find the inverse of $A$, we can multiply both sides of the equation by it to isolate $x$:

$A^{-1}Ax=A^{-1}b \Rightarrow x=A^{-1}b.$

## Where are matrices used in the real world?

Matrices have tons of real-world applications! They can be used in computer graphics to perform transformations on images, in physics to model physical systems, and in statistics to analyze data, just to name a few.
